        <h2>Why mundlejs?</h2>

<p>Lots of javascript loading up-front (concatenated) = long wait-time for initial page load.<br>
Loading all javascript asynchronously, as needed= too many requests resulting in poor performance and poor user experience.<br>
Manually optimizing concatenated scripts for deployment= a pain, and an insolvable probable for dynamic sites.</p>

<p>Symptom of all these problems: client-side code which is not truly modular and reusable, the way our server-side code is.</p>

<h2>What does it look like?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>For a step in the workflow where the user would expect a "loading" delay for the dependency:
<code>require('./someModule.js',myCallbackFunc);</code></p></li>
<li><p>For dependencies that you want to be available immediately:
<code>someModuleExports = require('./someModule.js');</code></p></li>
</ul><p>Your code does what it says- no processing before deployment to make it mean something different, and no fake synchronicity that gets covered up by a build step. Synchronous require in your client-side code means that module will be available immediately, asynchronous means you can arrange to keep the client busy while waiting for the module to load.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>The secret is that loading client-side modules is not a client only problem, a server-side component should exist and work hand-in-hand with the client. What the server-side does is parse synchronous dependencies (the second form in the "what?" section) and package them all together so they will be available immediately.</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Client-side code can be as modular as you like, without affecting real-life performance.</li>
<li>Really fast- caching of bundles is included, so it's faster than express even at serving single files</li>
<li>Very intuitive- when your code means what it says, everyone benefits</li>
<li>Build coffeescript, jade, etc. for the client on-the-fly, with cacheing.</li>
</ul><h3>Major byproduct benefit of this solution-</h3>

<p>We can have real client-side module managements, Ã  la npm for the client. Imagine this:<br><code>mundle install jQuery@1.7.6</code><br>
and in your client-side code:<br><code>$ = require('jQuery');</code><br>
And you're done!</p>

<p>Very easy with this solution and going to be implemented next. (I'm itching to do this right away.... but it's 0010 Monday morning... hmm....)</p>
